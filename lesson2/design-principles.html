                        <h2> Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                        <h3> Organization used: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/"> USA Today </a></h3>
                        <img class="photo_l2" src="/images/mobile_usatoday.jpg" alt="matias_smiling_in_parking_lot">
                        <p> When talking about visual heriarchy, sizes is what most people think of. For hundred of years magazines have printed
                            things with different sizes in order to indicate importance and significance. A newspapaer is an example of this, often
                            having a big picture and a headline to catch interest. This picture is often about the most recent important event. Then 
                            medium pictures are presented, for less important news. By doing so, a heriarchy is created where the pictures and their 
                            position on the page represent importance. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box box2">
                        <h2> Rule of Thirds</h2>
                        <h3> Organization used: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/"> National Geographic</a></h3>
                        <img class="photo_l2" src="/images/mobile_natgeo.jpg" alt="matias_smiling_in_parking_lot">
                        <p> The National Geographic page has a bunch of pictures that represent the rule of thirds. Not only 
                            that, but it also has three defined components, leaving the middle third of the page for the consumer
                            to see and focus on. As the rule of third states, this creates a sense of flow and direction for the pages.  </p>

                </div>
                <div class="box box3">
                        <h2> White Space and Clean Design</h2>
                        <h3> Organization used: <a href="https://www.genesisblockchain.io/"> Genesis Blockchain </a></h3>
                        <img class="photo_l2" src="/images/moblie_genesisblock.jpg" alt="matias_smiling_in_parking_lot">
                        <p> For this part I selected this page because it uses "white space" but with a black color. The 
                            background makes it so that every part of this page neat and looks like it is floating. Some 
                            interactive elements are lost in the mobile version, but the flow and tidiness is not. </p>
